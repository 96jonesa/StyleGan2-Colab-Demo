        "# How does StyleGAN2 work (somewhat technically)?\n",
        "\n",
        "GANs typically have a generator network and a discriminator network. The discriminator network is a glorified classification network - it seeks to determine if a given image came from the underlying data distribution under consideration (i.e. does it look like real data from the dataset being used for training). The generator network seeks to produce images that the discriminator will classify as having come from the underlying data distribution, however it does not get to look at the images in the dataset - it must improve based only on how the discriminator reacts to samples it produces. In order to generate diverse images, generator networks are given random noise as input. Typically during training, the discriminator network is fed some real data, then some generated data, then optimized via stochastic gradient descent. The generator network is optimized after getting the results back from the discriminator network, with fancy scheduling regarding how often each network is optimized (to induce stabilization) depending on the GAN architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "In StyleGAN2, the generator network is composed of a mapping network and a synthesis network. The mapping network is composed of a sequence of fully-connected layers which serve to transform the random noise input (latent code) into a vector in an intermediate latent space in which the factors of variation are more linear than in the original latent space (i.e. it maps the latent code into a space better topologically structured for the problem). Between the mapping and synthesis networks, affine transformations are learned to produce styles from the intermediate latent vector. These styles are fed as inputs to layers in modules of the synthesis network corresponding to different resolutions (from 4x4 up to the desired resolution). There are several convolutional (each along with standard deviation modulation and normalization) style blocks per resolution module. Per-style block scaling factors are also learned and applied to the noise before being input to intermediate layers of the corresponding style block. After a few style blocks, upsampling occurs to bump the network up to the next resolution (4x4 to 8x8 to 16x16 and so on) until the desired resolution is attained.\n",
        "\n",
        "StyleGAN2 also uses an exponential moving average of the generator (synthesis and mapping) network parameters to compensate for the oscillatory tendencies of GANs, as well as mixed regularities (occasionally using two latent space codes instead of one and simply switching from the intermediate latent vector produced by one to the intermediate latent vector produced by the other at a randomly selected point in the synthesis network, essentially mixing the styles which would be generated by the two). This difference in generated samples due to the addition of these techniques is demonstrated below.\n",
        "\n",
        "There has also been a very recent development in data augmentation that applies to GANs in general (differentiable augmentation), reducing the amount of data required to obtain high-quality results by (in some cases) orders of magnitude. The effect of applying this technique is demonstrated below."

In a soon-to-come update to this demo, the use of lower learning rates will be explored as a means of avoiding this issue.

This is due to the small amount of data available in the former two datasets, and a reasonable yet still lacking amount of data in the latter two datasets. A recent innovation in data augmentation which uses differentiable augmentations of the data has led to models obtaining high quality results with up to 70x less data. As long as the probability of applying these augmentations to each training sample is kept low enough, the generated images will not contain artifacts of the augmentations (e.g. warping, cropped removals, etc.). The following show the results of training the above models while applying this augmentation to the discriminator input with probability 0.2 at each iteration (the EMA generator (synthesis and mapping) parameters results are shown, without mixed regularities).

The EMA results are shown, and although they have improved on the results from the less trained models without augmentation, they are much worse than the results from further training with augmentation. The models (except for celeba, which has a much larger dataset) have collapsed into single representations of poor quality, and the afhq_dog model failed to stabilize after several attempts at training. In the case of cifar10_horse, there appears to be a case of overtraining due to the smaller image size - expect an update soon demonstrating and explaining the deterioration of the quality from its peak.
